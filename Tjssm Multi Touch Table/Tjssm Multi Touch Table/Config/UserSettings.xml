    <!-- 
    These settings are used to allow the tracking data to match the projected area when the projection
    is scaled and/or offset.  This is the case if you alter the tracking area to the physical surface area
    in your tracking software and do not modify the screen area to match the surface area for the projection.
    
    On a full screen setup with no tracking area changes and no projection scale or offset, the defaults should be fine.
    E.g. on a LCD touch panel.
    
    ScaleX and ScaleY
    
    Stretches the points apart on the X and Y axis.  
    Use this if your TUIO sender sends points for a larger screensize than your projected area.
    
    PosY and PosX
    
    Control the projection offset.  Modify this if your TUIO sender sends points offset.
    A value between 0 and 1 of normalised screen size.
    E.g. a value of 0.5 would move the points down by half the screen.
    
    Note: PosY is inverted so a value of 0.5 will move the points up by half the screen.
